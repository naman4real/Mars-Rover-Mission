# Mars-Rover-Mission
In this project, we twist the problem of path planning a little bit just to give you the opportunity
to deepen your understanding of search algorithms by modifying search techniques to fit the
criteria of a realistic problem. To give you a realistic context for expanding your ideas about
search algorithms, we invite you to take part in a Mars exploration mission. The goal of this
mission is to send a sophisticated mobile lab to Mars to study the surface of the planet more
closely. We are invited to develop an algorithm to find the optimal path for navigation of the
rover based on a particular objective.
The input of our program includes a topographical map of the mission site, plus some
information about intended landing site and target locations and some other quantities that
control the quality of the solution. The surface of the planet can be imagined as a surface in a 3-
dimensional space. A popular way to represent a surface in 3D space is using a mesh-grid with a
Z value assigned to each cell that identifies the elevation of the planet at the location of the
cell. At each cell, the rover can move to each of 8 possible neighbor cells: North, North-East,
East, South-East, South, South-West, West, and North-West. Actions are assumed to be
deterministic and error-free (the rover will always end up at the intended neighbor cell).
The rover is not designed to climb across steep hills and thus moving to a neighboring cell
which requires the rover to climb up or down a surface which is steeper than a particular
threshold value is not allowed. This maximum slope (expressed as a difference in Z elevation
between adjacent cells) will be given as an input along with the topographical map.

Our task is to move the rover from its landing site to one of the target sites for experiments and
soil sampling. For an ideal rover that can cross every place, usually the shortest geometrical
path is defined as the optimal path; however, since in this project we have some operational
concerns, our objective is first to avoid steep areas and thus we want to minimize the path from
A to B under those constraints. Thus, our goal is, roughly, finding the shortest path among the
safe paths. What defines the safety of a path is the maximum slope between any two adjacent
cells along that path.

We will write a program that will take an input file that describes the terrain map, landing site,
target sites, and characteristics of the robot. For each target site, you should find the optimal
(shortest) safe path from the landing site to that target. A path is composed of a sequence of
elementary moves. Each elementary move consists of moving the rover to one of its 8 neighbors.
To find the solution you will use the following algorithms:
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Uniform-cost search (UCS)
- A* search (A*).
